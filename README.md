In this repository, we will learn a basic workflow when using ML to solve a practical problem in Python
<ul>
  <li>exploratory data analysis (EDA) (will be updated later)</li>
  <li>data processing</li>
  <li>train machine learning and deep learning models</li>
  <li>make predictions on new data and evaluation. </li>
</ul>
Detailed implementaion is described in each Jupyter notebook.
